            I am applying for the Entry-Level Software Engineer role at Google,
            located in Guelph. I deeply admire the level of innovation at
            Google, especially its ability to cultivate a culture that fosters
            new ideas and embraces learning from mistakes. I am motivated by
            solving meaningful challenges, and I believe Google will have many
            of these due to its constant innovation culture.

            I completed a Software Engineering Bootcamp from a U.S. online
            school while working as a microbiologist, and I am currently
            pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s in Software Engineering at WGU. Although my
            academic background began in chemistry, biochemistry, and biology,
            this training strengthened my critical thinking and problem-solving
            skills. After five years in a microbiological lab, I realized the
            impact that technology and automation could have on scientific
            workflows. This realization fueled my decision to learn coding and
            explore areas like cloud systems and artificial intelligence, which
            continue to inspire my journey in software engineering.

            My technical skills include JavaScript, SQL, React, Node.js, and
            PostgreSQL, complemented by GitHub proficiency and foundational
            Python knowledge. I bring consistency, analytical thinking,
            teamwork, and a natural curiosity to understand processes. I believe
            this combination of technical expertise and soft skills would make
            me a valuable contributor to Googleâ€™s Software Engineering team.

            I am very excited about the possibility of contributing to Google. I
            am open to working on any project and am committed to always
            delivering my best work. Thank you for considering my application.
