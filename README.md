As part of WGU course Web Development, the assigment instructions are:

You will write your own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code—no frameworks will be allowed. Do not use online media links—all image, audio, and video files must be stored locally with your code.


Your submission should include:

•   3 HTML files: resume.html, cover-letter.html, and career-goals.html

•   1 external CSS file: master.css or style.css

•   At least 1 image file (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, or .gif)

•   1 audio file (.mp3 or .wav)

•   1 video file (.mp4, .mov, or .mpeg)
